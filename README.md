This course aims to provide the simplest, most practical introduction to Python programming — designed so that anyone can learn everything it takes to get started in 60 minutes or less. You will learn the core building blocks of Python step by step, from printing text and using variables to writing loops, creating functions, and even building simple classes and objects.

This is not an in-depth course. It will not teach you how to be a Michelin-star chef — but it will teach you how to use the basic tools of the trade so you can cook yourself a simple meal. Think of this course as teaching you how to hold the knife, boil water, and use the oven — enough to feel confident in the kitchen so you can explore recipes on your own.

After completing this course, you will be empowered to continue learning independently — and that is a powerful kind of freedom. The Python community is massive, with endless resources available online. From beginner-friendly tutorials on sites like W3Schools and Real Python to detailed answers to obscure bugs on Stack Overflow, you can usually find solutions to your questions in minutes. This is a complete paradigm shift from traditional academia, where information can feel locked away or mystified. In programming, the answers are open, searchable, and shared by a global community.

That accessibility is what makes programming so powerful: once you know the basics, you are no longer stuck waiting for a teacher or textbook to tell you what to do next — you can build, experiment, break things, fix them, and grow your skills as fast as your curiosity allows.
